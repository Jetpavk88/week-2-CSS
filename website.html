    <ul>

        <li><h2T>The reason I chose “The Great City of Giza” was because this place has so many different attractions and also has urban myths to go along with it for the tourists. 
            You can go see places like The Great Spinx of Giza, Pyramid of Khafre, Giza Plateau…Etc. 
            All these attractions has been around for a while now. This city also happens to be the 7th wonder of the world. So this place has to offer any adventurer.</h2>

        <h1>Pyramids of Giza</h1>

     <ul>
            <li>Khufu's pyramid, known as the great pyramid of Giza, is the oldest and largest, rising at 481 feet (146 meters). 
                Archeologists say it was the tallest structure in the world for about 3, 800 years.</li>
            <li>The sphinx is a 73.5-meter (241 ft.) long monument built during the reign of Khafra. 
                The creature is a mythical being commonly found in Greek, Egyptian and even South Asian ancient architecture.</li>
            <li>Khafre and Menkaure pyramids are much smaller and simpler in design than Khufu’s massive structure.  
                When first built, the pyramids were covered in white limestone much of which eroded over the years</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular depictions, the Egyptian pyramids were not built by large groups of slaves or prisoners, many historians say. 
                Egyptians were employed and archeologists estimate the workers would have had to set a 2.5 to 15 ton block 
                every two and a half minutes to finish Khufu’s pyramid in about 30 years.</li>

        <h1 >*Orion's belt and the Giza Plateau*</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>We know from The Pyramid Texts, which are among the oldest religious writings in the world, 
                that the ancient Egyptians believed that the gods descended from the belt of Orion and from Sirius 
                (the brightest star in the sky) in the form of human beings. 
                This is critically important to Egyptian cosmology, 
                as Orion was associated with the god Osiris and Sirius was associated with the goddess Isis, 
                who together are said to have created the whole of human civilization.
            </li>
            <li>The three pyramids of Giza are some of the most mysterious, perplexing, and magnificent ancient structures in the world. 
                Together they demonstrate the concept of sacred alignment, as they form a precise three dimensional map of the stars in the belt of Orion onto the ground. 
                Their size and placement also takes into account both the visible brightness and location of the stars within Orion’s belt, 
                as the two larger pyramids are lined up perfectly in comparison to the smaller offset pyramid of Menkuare.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the Giza plateau is located at the geographical center of the Earth, 
                which means that it is positioned exactly in the center of the Earth’s landmass. 
                The central pyramid, Khufu, is not only the last remaining of The 7 Wonders of the Ancient World, 
                but is more aligned to true North than the Greenwich observatory in London.</li>
